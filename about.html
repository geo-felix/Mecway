        <h2>Our Background</h2>
        <p>MEC was established in 2013 by a teacher well educated, 
          dynamic and focused leader working in the development sector 
          to address the problem of orphans, street kids & vulnerable children
          within the informal settlements of Mathare.</p>
        <P>Considering her association with the development sector the founder 
          was cognizant of the plethora of problems plaguing the Mathare slums</P>
        <P>True to this spirit the organization was named MOTHERWAY EDUCATION CENTRE MEC
          It was registered as CBO with Government of Kenya ministry of Gender, Children 
          & Social Development.
        </P>
        <p>MOTHERWAY EDUCATION CENTRE is an independent registered non-govemment and nonprofit
          CBO based in Nairobi Kenya.
          We are located in Mathare north where we run a secondary school for both gender.
