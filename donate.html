          <h2>Target Group</h2>
          <p>We seek to help destitute children in the slums and streets of Nairobi who
            for various reasons of poverty, family breakdown, abuse or neglect, live 
            in situations of suffering, hunger, lack of love and lack of education. 
            The children we help are both boys and girls often from single parent/guardian
            homes or are orphaned or are children who have lost their parents due to various
            reasons such as HIV/AIDS, corona virus, abandonment etc. We also try to provide
            some limited family assistance to those in need by way of practical support and
            counseling.
          </p>
          <p>We assist these children in a number of ways, focusing on provision of basic needs
            and with a particular emphasis on education. Our aim is to support each needy child
            to be stable & happy & to reach a stage where they are self-sufficient. We also aim
            at encouraging knowledge of & relationship with God, so that each child becomes the
            best person they can be and can contribute to their society as a useful and upright
            citizen.

            to poor families from the community & orphans regardless of their religion or faith. Each class
            has a maximum of 36 students. the education is free. Here you see the children happy and growing,
            in spite of the many challenges they each have faced.

          <P>School Sponsorship Fund (SSF) We give limited assistance for school fees for needy secondary
            students and orphans (current maximum of about 50 students) other practical support is also
            provided depending on the student's circumstances. Christian counseling is given to these
            students each month to help them cope with the pressures and temptations of modern life. 
            Assistance depends on good academic performance and good behaviors in school.
